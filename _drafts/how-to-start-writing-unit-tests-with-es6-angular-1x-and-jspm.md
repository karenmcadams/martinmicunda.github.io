title: How to start writing unit tests with ES6, Angular 1.x and JSPM
subtitle: "ES6 unit tests workflow with JSPM"

excerpt: "Couple weeks ago I have started to work on one of my personal projects (Employee Scheduling) and at that time I didn't think I will write any of my code in ES6 not because I wouldn't want to try one of the cool ES6 features but I was more concerned how to automating my development workflow with ES6 and I also want to get my code to production until I watched Guy Bedford video from JSConf2014 where he was talking about ES6 modules workflow using JSPM."
